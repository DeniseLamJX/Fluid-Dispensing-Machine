# Fluid-Dispensing-Machine

The aim of the project was to build a mobile multi-purpose machine that can dispense fluid for indoor purposes.

The machine was programmed using Arduino. Users will input the width and height of the target area that the machine is intended to cover through a display situated at the top layer of the base, and the spray will be adjusted accordingly.

Servo and Stepper Motors were used. This repository contains the code used for operating, coordinating and testing the different components of the machine.
